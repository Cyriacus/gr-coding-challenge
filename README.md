### ABOUT THE PROJECT
# 
# This application gathers data and generates a productivity report for teams or individual engineers/contributors from a GitHub repository. The application is written in Python. 
#
#
#
### TO RUN THE APPLICATION, FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS
#
# 1. You need to have python3 ( brew install python3 ) installed in your computer (PC, MAC).
# 2. You need to also installed python libary "requests" (python3 -m pip install requests), which provides a simple API for interacting with HTTP operations such as GET , POST , etc.
# 3. Clone the Git Repo (git clone https://github.com/Cyriacus/gr-coding-challenge.git) to you local repository and CD to the file where is been stored. 
# 3. Use Visual Studio compiler terminal/MAC terminal/ PC CLI to run and compile the code. Example using MAC terminal: python3 activity_tracker.py (The output of the program comes out as a text file which shows the activity of each of the contributors)
# 
#
#
### FUTURE VERSIONS AND IMPROVEMENT
#
# User Interface:
# The application can be further improved by providing a user-friendly interface, which can be build using a framework like Flask or Django to visualize the data and allow users to interact with it via GUI especially for non-technical users.
#
# Automation:
# You can schedule data gathering and report generation tasks to run at regular intervals using tools like cron jobs (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to keep the data up-to-date.
#
# Testing and Deployment:
# The application can be tested thoroughly to ensure accuracy and reliability. It can also be deployed in a server or cloud platform so that it can run continuously.
